## app-emulation/wine-lutris

These are Gentoo's wine-vanilla ebuilds with the source files sourced from Lutris' wine repo and the wine-mono version updated. These are experimental ebuilds; they are not guaranteed to work. They support esync and fsync. This is the patchset that I reccomend.

## app-emulation/wine-tkg

These are Gentoo's wine-vanilla ebuilds with the source files sourced from Tk-Glitch's wine-tkg repo and the wine-mono version updated. These are experimental ebuilds; they are not guaranteed to work. They support esync and fsync. These seem to be more unstable from some small empirical tests.
